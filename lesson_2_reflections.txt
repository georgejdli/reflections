1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When I initialize a repository, a .git folder is created. This folder contains all the commits
	that I will make (and the information on them). If I don't do it then git can't track the 
	different versions of my files.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is in between the working directory and the repository. The working directory holds
	the files that you are currently editing. You may or may not want to save those changes. You may
	be working on multiple files. The staging area allows you to hold a file for commit as you are done
	making the changes. Then you can changes another file and more if necessary. When you are ready
	to make a logical commit, the staging area allows you to commit changes to more than one
	file at once so you don't have to clutter your git log with multiple commits of the same logical
	reason.
