1. When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
  
  If I were collaborating with others or if I had to do my work on different computers then I would want
  to create a remote repository. If someone made an acceptable change then I could pull that change and continue
  my work. If I made a change on one computer but then had to switch to another one later I could push a 
  commit to the remote repository, then pull that commit to another computer and continue working from there.

 2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 	If you're collaborating with others you may not always want their changes on your local repository
 	yet. Say you're working on a file, take a break, and a contributor pushes a change. If Git pulled the
 	changes automatically, you might get confused or not even notice that your file was modified. That
 	could lead to some headaches as you try to resume your work.
